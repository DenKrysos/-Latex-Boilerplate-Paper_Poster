    ABSTRACT={\begingroup
        {Industry 4.0 (I4.0), Digitalization, Automation, 5G. These count among the major leading subjects of our time. Unarguably, they afford remarkable room for progression of human society. Behind all these resides the basic idea of increasing the output and decreasing the required human input in terms of an individualâ€™s invested effort. Exactly that idea is also the main goal for this paper. Given the mentioned key topics, all goes down to interacting machines, which means automated communication. But before the state of automated communicating machines, always human effort has to be invested. A network has to be built, this network needs to be configured and not to forget, the communicating applications have to be developed to start with. Nowadays, this always requires a significant amount of expert consideration and manual setting-up, induces rigid environments, restrict compatibility and also bears susceptibility for failure. This is mostly due to the fact that the actual communication itself, that is, peculiarities of the underlying transmission technology must be handled. To eradicate the dependency, an interlayer was developed and implemented, which detaches a communicating entity from the communication itself. This manifests itself in various respects. The resulting work simplifies the process of communication and operation of a physical network for every participating party regardless of the actual roll-out. In addition, already before the phase of deployment and operation, the process of developing an network application is also vastly simplified since from an application nothing is required but announcing its communication intention and sending out messages.}\endgroup}
